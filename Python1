#A taxi driver is calculating their profit over two weeks by adding up the fares they charge and subtracting the cost of gas. 
#The price of gas changes over time - it was $3.52/gallon the first week and $3.57/gallon this second week. 
#Their car gets 20 miles per gallon.
#For the first week the driver had a total of 23 passengers with average $29 fare each, and drove a total of 160 miles. 
#For the second week they had 17 passengers with average $30 fare each, and drove a total of 220 miles. 
#Assume that for both weeks they purchase all the gas needed during that week (i.e. they refuel every week to maintain a constant level of gas in the tank).
#Based on the above, answer the following questions:
#What is their total profit over both weeks
#During which week was their average (mean) profit per passenger higher?
